			<p>I love all types of music, so I decided to catalog a few of my favorite bands on this website. The three artists I am have been touring from the 1960's to the present, and all had an immense impact on the music industry, and their respective genres. Unfortunately, the leaders of all these bands have passed away, so I have not been able to see the original bands live in concert, but their music still lives on and is appreciated by millions everyday. </p>
